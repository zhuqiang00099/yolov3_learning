This package contains the "Brainwash" dataset. The dataset consists of images capturing the everyday
life of a busy downtown cafe and is split into the following subsets:

training set: 10769 with 81975 annotated people
validation set: 500 images with 3318 annotated people
test set: 500 images with 5007 annotated people

Bounding box annotations are provided in a simple text file format. Each line in the file contains
image name followed by the list of annotation rectangles in the [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] format.

We refer to the following arXiv submission for details on the dataset and the evaluation
procedure:
